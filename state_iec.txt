Check back in early December for an update. What's International Experience Canada (IEC)? International Experience Canada (IEC) is a program based on Youth Mobility Agreements (YMA) signed by Canada and 35 other countries to facilitate work and travel opportunities for Canadian national youth wanting to go abroad, and foreign youth wanting to come to Canada. International Internship Network (IIN) has been designated a Recognized Organization (RO) by the Canadian government to help promote the International Experience Canada (IEC) program. Being an RO allows foreign IEC program applicants certain benefits that direct pool applicants may not have, such as guaranteed Invitations to Apply (ITA) from the Canadian government, faster application processing times, age extension to 35 years and more! ROs can also help Canadian youth looking to go abroad either through a Co-op/Internship or as a graduate professional looking to live and work in a YMA country. IIN can help by offering advice, resources and connecting you with our local network partners so that your experience abroad can be as seamless and stress free as possible! Countries with Youth Mobility Agreements facilitate three different permits you can apply for, each with their own requirements. The Co-op Internship and Young Professional permits are employer dependent , while the Working Holiday permit is an open-work permit , meaning that you do not have to have an employment offer in order to apply. *Each YMA country may name the above mentioned permits differently but the equivalent opportunities are available IEC Partner Countries &amp; Territories Who can apply? To be eligible for this program you must: \ud83e\uddd2\ud83c\udffd Be a young person (18-30/35) and a citizen of a YMA country \ud83d\udec2 Have a valid passport for the duration of your stay \u2705 Have a clean criminal record \ud83d\udcb3 Have enough savings in the bank ($3000 approx*) \ud83d\udcdc Be enrolled in a post-secondary educational institution in your country (for Co-op Visa applicants only) \ud83e\ude7a Have IEC compliant insurance for the duration of your permit *Check the specific eligibility for different YMA countries in the International Experience Canada program here .
